getting started with Angular:

1.intro and doc
2.create a simple app
3.basic scaffolding
4.declarative framework
5.using forms
6.services
7.routes
8.lazy loading

1.intro and doc
requirements: 
- install nodejs (lts version is ok)
- install CLI by runing 'npm install -g @angular/cli'
no problem using the last CLI version if the app's is older.
https://angular.io/
use the appropiate version of your app.

2.create a simple app
run the fallowing on your workspace:
'ng new learnAngular --skip-tests --style scss --minimal --routing'
and when the cmd is finished 'ng serve -o'
'new' is used to create an app or library (go in deep other day)
'--skip-tests' wont create specs files
'--style' defines the styling extension (css, less, sass, scss)
'--minimal' wont install karma and test engines..
'--routing' created default routing file for base module
- hot reload: cool tool.

3.basic scaffolding
show dir structure

4.declarative framework
- interpolation
- two way binding!
- event oriented
- directives

5.using forms
- reactiveForms

6.services
- DI and reusability
Dependencies are services or objects that a class needs to perform its function. DI is a coding pattern in which a class asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.
- subscribe to a service
- observables
- rxjs operators

7.routes
- navigation
- queryParams

8.lazy loading
- only if we've got time
